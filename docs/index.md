# Cloud Foundry Provider

The Cloud Foundry (cloudfoundry) provider is used to interact with a
Cloud Foundry target to perform administrative configuration of platform
resources, or user actions (such as pushing a cf app).

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Set the variable values in *.tfvars file
# or using -var="api_url=..." CLI option

variable "api_url" {}
variable "password" {}
variable "uaa_admin_client_secret" {}

# Configure the CloudFoundry Provider

provider "cloudfoundry" {
    api_url = var.api_url
    user = "admin"
    password = var.password
    uaa_client_id = "admin"
    uaa_client_secret = var.uaa_admin_client_secret
    skip_ssl_validation = true
    app_logs_max = 30
}
```
