# cloudfoundry\_app

Provides a Cloud Foundry [application](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) resource.

## Example Usage

The following example creates an application.

```hcl
resource "cloudfoundry_app" "spring-music" {
    name = "spring-music"
    path = "/Work/cloudfoundry/apps/spring-music/build/libs/spring-music.war"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the application.
* `space` - (Required) The GUID of the associated Cloud Foundry space.
* `instances` - (Optional, Number) The number of app instances that you want to start. Defaults to 1.
* `memory` - (Optional, Number) The memory limit for each application instance in megabytes. If not provided, value is computed and retreived from Cloud Foundry.
* `disk_quota` - (Optional, Number) The disk space to be allocated for each application instance in megabytes. If not provided, default disk quota is retrieved from Cloud Foundry and assigned.
* `stack` - (Optional) The name of the stack the application will be deployed to. Use the [`cloudfoundry_stack`](website/docs/d/stack.html.markdown) data resource to lookup the available stack names to override Cloud Foundry default.
* `buildpack` - (Optional, String) The buildpack used to stage the application. There are multiple options to choose from:
  * a Git URL (e.g. [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git)) or a Git URL with a branch or tag (e.g. [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git#v3.3.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git#v3.3.0) for v3.3.0 tag)
  * an installed admin buildpack name (e.g. my-buildpack)
  * an empty blank string to use built-in buildpacks (i.e. autodetection)
* `buildpacks` - (Optional, List) Multiple `buildpacks` used to stage the application. When both `buildpack` and `buildpacks` are set, `buildpacks` wins. There are multiple options to choose from:
  * a Git URL (e.g. [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git)) or a Git URL with a branch or tag (e.g. [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git#v3.3.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git#v3.3.0) for v3.3.0 tag)
  * an installed admin buildpack name (e.g. my-buildpack)
* `command` - (Optional, String) A custom start command for the application. This overrides the start command provided by the buildpack.
* `enable_ssh` - (Optional, Boolean) Whether to enable or disable SSH access to the container. Default is `true` unless disabled globally.
* `timeout` - (Optional, Number) Max wait time for app instance startup, in seconds. Defaults to 60 seconds.
* `stopped` - (Optional, Boolean) Defines the desired application state. Set to `true` to have the application remain in a stopped state. Default is `false`, i.e. application will be started.
* `labels` - (Optional, map string of string) Add labels as described [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/metadata.html#-view-metadata-for-an-object).
  Works only on cloud foundry with api >= v3.63.
* `annotations` - (Optional, map string of string) Add annotations as described [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/metadata.html#-view-metadata-for-an-object).
  Works only on cloud foundry with api >= v3.63.

### Application Source / Binary

One of the following arguments must be declared to locate application source or archive to be pushed.

* `path` - (Required) An uri or path to target a zip file. this can be in the form of unix path (`/my/path.zip`) or url path (`http://zip.com/my.zip`)
* `source_code_hash` - (Optional) Used to trigger updates. Must be set to a base64-encoded SHA256 hash of the path specified. The usual way to set this is `${base64sha256(file("file.zip"))}`,
  where "file.zip" is the local filename of the lambda function source archive.

* `docker_image` - (Optional, String) The URL to the docker image with tag e.g registry.example.com:5000/user/repository/tag or docker image name from the public repo e.g. redis:4.0
* `docker_credentials` - (Optional) Defines login credentials for private docker repositories
  * `username` - (Required, String) Username for the private docker repo
  * `password` - (Required, String) Password for the private docker repo

~> **NOTE:** [terraform-provider-zipper](https://github.com/ArthurHlt/terraform-provider-zipper)
can create zip file from `tar.gz`, `tar.bz2`, `folder location`, `git repo` locally or remotely and provide `source_code_hash`.

Example Usage with zipper

```hcl
provider "zipper" {
  skip_ssl_validation = false
}

resource "zipper_file" "fixture" {
  source = "https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/gobis-server.git#v1.7.3"
  output_path = "path/to/gobis-server.zip"
}

resource "cloudfoundry_app" "gobis-server" {
    name = "gobis-server"
    path = zipper_file.fixture.output_path
    source_code_hash = zipper_file.fixture.output_sha
    buildpack = "go_buildpack"
}
```

### Application Deployment strategy

* `strategy` - (Required) Strategy to use for creating/updating application. Defaults to `none`
Supported options:
  * `none`:
    * Alias: `standard`, `v2`
    * Description: perform restage/create/restart **with** interruption
  * `blue-green`:
    * Alias: `blue-green-v2`
    * Description: perform restage and create app **without** interruption and rollback if an error occurred (using the "venerable" blue-green pattern commonly used with CAPI v2, requires double the overall app memory available in quota). More details [here](#blue-green-deployment-strategy).
  * `rolling`:
    * Description: perform restage and create app **without** interruption and rollback if an error occurred (using the `rolling` strategy provided in CAPI v3, requires memory for a single app instance available in quota)

### Service bindings

* `service_binding` - (Optional, Array) Service instances to bind to the application.
  * `service_instance` - (Required, String) The service instance GUID.
  * `params` - (Optional, Map) A list of key/value parameters used by the service broker to create the binding. Defaults to empty map.

~> **NOTE:** Modifying this argument will cause the application to be restaged.
~> **NOTE:** Resource only manages service binding previously set by resource.

### Routing

* `routes` - (Optional, block) The routes to map to the application to control its ingress traffic.
  * `route` - (Required, String) The route id. Route can be defined using the `cloudfoundry_route` resource
  * `port` - (Number) The port of the application to map the tcp route to.

~> **NOTE:** in the future, the `route` block will support the `port` attribute illustrated above to allow mapping of tcp routes, and listening on custom or multiple ports.  
~> **NOTE:** Route mappings can be controlled from either the `cloudfoundry_app.routes` or the `cloudfoundry_routes.target` attributes. Using both syntaxes will cause conflicts and result in unpredictable behavior.  
~> **NOTE:** A given route can not currently be mapped to more than one application using the `cloudfoundry_app.routes` syntax. As an alternative, use the `cloudfoundry_route.target` syntax instead in this specific use-case.  
~> **NOTE:** Resource only manages route mapping previously set by resource.

#### Example usage

```hcl
resource "cloudfoundry_app" "java-spring" {
# [...]
 routes {
    route = cloudfoundry_route.java-spring.id
 }
 routes {
    route = cloudfoundry_route.java-spring-2.id
 }
}
```

### Environment Variables

* `environment` - (Optional, Map) Key/value pairs of custom environment variables to set in your app. Does not include any [system or service variables](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#app-system-env).

~> **NOTE:** Modifying this argument will cause the application to be restaged.

### Health Checks

* `health_check_http_endpoint` -(Optional, String) The endpoint for the http health check type. The default is '/'.
* `health_check_type` - (Optional, String) The health check type which can be one of "`port`", "`process`", "`http`". Default is "`port`".
* `health_check_timeout` - (Optional, Number) The timeout in seconds for the health check.
* `health_check_invocation_timeout` - (Optional, Number) The timeout in seconds for individual health check requests for "`http`" and "`port`" health checks.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported along with any defaults for the inputs attributes.

* `id` - The GUID of the application
* `id_bg` - The GUID of the application updated by resource when strategy is blue-green.

This allows changes to a resource linked to app resource id to be updated when app will be recreated.

## Timeouts

* App instance startup timeout - see the `timeout` argument.
* App staging timeout - 15 mins.
* Service binding timeout - 5 mins.

## Import

The current App can be imported using the `app` GUID, e.g.

```bash
terraform import cloudfoundry_app.spring-music a-guid
```

## blue-green deployment strategy

### Update resource using blue-green app id

This is an example of usage of `id_bg` attribute to update your resource on a changing app id by blue-green:

```hcl
resource "cloudfoundry_app" "test-app-bg" {
    space            = "apaceid"
    buildpack        = "abuildpack"
    name             = "test-app-bg"
    path             = "myapp.zip"
    strategy         = "blue-green-v2"
    routes {
      route = "arouteid"
    }
}

resource "cloudfoundry_app" "test-app-bg2" {
  space            = "apaceid"
  buildpack        = "abuildpack"
  name             = "test-app-bg2"
  path             = "myapp.zip"
  strategy         = "blue-green-v2"
  routes {
    route = "arouteid"
  }
}

resource "cloudfoundry_network_policy" "my-policy" {
  policy {
    destination_app = cloudfoundry_app.test-app-bg2.id_bg
    port            = "8080"
    protocol        = "tcp"
    source_app      = cloudfoundry_app.test-app-bg.id_bg
  }
}

# When you change either test-app-bg or test-app-bg2 this will affect my-policy to be updated because it use `id_bg` instead of id
```

### Known issues and workarounds

* `bg_post_startup_wait_time`: Some apps can take a few moments to be fully up even after Cloudfoundry declared them "started" : database schema migrations, establishing connections to clients... This can cause performance issues if the venerable app is deleted when the new app was not fully "started" (even if Cloudfoundry was showing it started). This adds a preconfigured delay in seconds before killing the venerable app, to let time to the new instance to warmup.
